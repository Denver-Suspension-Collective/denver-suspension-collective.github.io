# Denver Suspension Collective

## What is Hook Suspension?
Hook suspension - or body suspension - is a practice where individuals are temporarily suspended by hooks placed through the skin. While many cultures througout history have had versions of this practice, contemporary suspension has evolved into a form of personal expression, performance art, and ritualistic practice. Each suspension is unique, with various positions and configurations possible, and each person setting their own intention for the experience.

## What is the Denver Suspension Collective?
The Denver Suspension Collective is an established group of suspension practitioners and enthusiasts who have been facilitation suspensions in Colorado since 2015. Our mission is to create an inclusive, supportive environment where people can safely explore suspension under expert guidance. We prioritize education, safety protocols, and creating connections within the global suspension community.
