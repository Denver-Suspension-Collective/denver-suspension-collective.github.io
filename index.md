    <h4 class="h4">What is Hook Suspension?</h4>
    <p>
        Hook suspension &mdash; or body suspension &mdash; is a practice where individuals are temporarily suspended by hooks placed through the skin. While many cultures throughout history have had versions of this practice, contemporary suspension has evolved into a form of personal expression, performance art, and ritualistic practice. Each suspension is unique, with various positions and configurations possible, and each person setting their own intention for the experience.
