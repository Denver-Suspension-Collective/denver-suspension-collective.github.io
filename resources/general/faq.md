*Common questions about hook suspension.*

{% include heading_block.html title="Before Your Suspension" %}

#### What should I do to prepare for my first suspension?

Before your suspension, it's important to:

* Be well-rested, hydrated, and nourished. Eat a small, balanced meal a few hours before.

* Stay sober, as we cannot safely and ethically suspend you if you are under the influence.

* Wear comfortable clothing suitable for the position you plan on suspending in and bring an extra set in case of contamination.

* Consider bringing a friend or family member for emotional support.

* Medical Conditions: Inform your practitioner if you have conditions like epilepsy, bleeding disorders, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These conditions could affect your safety and the approach to your suspension.

#### What will happen when I arrive for my suspension?

Upon arrival:

* We'll discuss the procedure and determine the best hook placement.

* Your skin will be cleaned with antiseptic and marked for precise hook insertion.

* You'll lie on a massage bed for the piercings, which may be done in tandem to minimize discomfort.

#### How does the suspension process work?

During the suspension:

* After piercing, you will be guided to the suspension point where hooks are attached to ropes.

* A coach will help you gradually lift off the ground, communicating to the person operating the pulleys to adjust tension.

* If you feel uncomfortable, communicate with your coach to adjust the pace.

#### Can I document my suspension experience?

* Photos: Allowed during both the piercing and suspension phases.

* Videos: Permitted only during the suspension. No video recording is allowed during the piercing process.

#### What aftercare should I follow?

* Keep the bandages on for the remainder of the day; you may leave them on overnight if that is more convenient.

* After removing bandages, wash the wounds gently with soap and water. Re-bandaging is optional and only recommended if you have significant blood spotting.

* Expect some blood spotting and sleep on a towel for the first couple of nights if you're concerned about staining sheets with blood.

* Scarring: Everyone scars differently, and some scarring should be expected. Not picking at scabs will help minimize scarring. Let scabs heal naturally to prevent further scarring and reduce the risk of infection.

* Subcutaneous emphysema: You may experience trapped air underneath your skin, which can create a popping sensation when you move your joints or press on the skin. This is normal and can sometimes move quite a distance from your wounds. It may cause slight muscle aches. Gentle massaging may relieve some of this pressure but it will go away on its own within one to two weeks.

* Contact us if you have any concerns about your wounds or general health post-suspension.

#### How soon can I resume physical activities?

* Take it easy for the first 24-48 hours. Gentle activities like walking or yoga are advisable if you feel up to it.

* Avoid strenuous exercises and public water bodies for one week to prevent infection and aid healing.

#### How do I know if my wounds are infected?

While we take many steps to minimize the risk of infection, mild infections can sometimes occur.

Signs of infection include:

* Fever within 48 hours
* Redness
* Swelling
* Increased pain
* Excessive or persistent ooze
* Pus or smelly discharge

If you're concerned about possible signs of infection or symptoms worsen over several days, consult with your primary care physician or an urgent care facility about additional treatment.

#### What emotional reactions might I experience?

* Some people report being physically or emotionally drained due to the intense experience. It may be helpful to take 24 hours off emotionally stressful activities to give you space to process.

* If you need to talk, feel free to reach out at any time.
