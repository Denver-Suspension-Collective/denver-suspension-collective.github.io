*How to reprocess hooks and instruments.*

{% include heading_block.html title="Removal of Hooks and Transport" %}

1. Wipe hooks and instruments carefully with an *Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (AHP) wipe* (e.g. an Optim wipe) to remove any visible debris and organic material. Ensure that every surface is wiped, including thread and crevices.

1. Place the hooks directly into a puncture-resistant, leak-proof container.

1. Spray *All-in-ONE&trade; Surgical Instrument Cleaner* from a foaming sprayer inside the container to prevent the drying of organic material.

1. Securely close the container with the hooks and transport it to the designated cleaning and processing area.

#### Prepare Ultrasonic Solution

1. Dilute 1.25 ounces of *Tergazyme Enzyme-Active Powdered Detergent* in 1 gallon of distilled water in the ultrasonic cleaner. Set the temperature to 120&deg; F.

1. Turn on the ultrasonic cleaner and degas for 5 minutes.

#### Initial Scrub

1. Place the ultrasonic basket on a tray in the processing area next to the hook and instrument container.

1. Use an AHP wipe to scrub all crevices and threads on each individual component. Place the cleaned items into the ultrasonic basket, ensuring that the items are not overcrowded.

#### Ultrasonic Cleaning

1. Turn on the HEPA air purifier.

1. Ensure the ultrasonic solution has reached the correct temperature.

1. Slowly lower the ultrasonic cleaner basket into the solution to avoid splashing. Ensure all items are fully submerged and nothing is left on the tray.

1. Place the lid on the ultrasonic cleaner and cover it with plastic wrap.

1. Run the ultrasonic cleaner for 10 minutes.

1. After the cycle completes, remove the plastic wrap and lid, and then remove the basket from the ultrasonic cleaner. Place it on a tray.

1. Rinse the parts thoroughly under running tap water to remove any remaining debris and cleaning solution.

1. Place the parts into a container with distilled water to dilute away any impurities from the tap water.

1. Drain the ultrasonic cleaner and check for any parts that may have fallen through the basket onto the bottom. Rinse and place any found items into the container with distilled water.

1. Drain the container with parts and distilled water.

{% include heading_block.html title="Inspection and Packaging" %}

1. Prepare a clean tray lined with paper towels.

1. Remove the parts from the container and place them on the tray, drying each part individually. Group similar items together for packaging.

1. Visually inspect each hook and instrument under adequate lighting to ensure that all organic material and debris have been removed, and that no damage is visible.

1. Count the number of packages required for each size to package all the parts.

1. In the clean room, retrieve the necessary packages and date-stamp them.

1. Once the parts are dry, spray the hinges of any hinged tools with lubricant and package the items as needed.

{% include heading_block.html title="Autoclave Sterilization" %}

1. Move the tray to the clean room for sterilization.

1. Turn on the HEPA air purifier.

1. Ensure that the autoclave reservoir is full.

1. Load the packaged hooks, a Type 5 sterilization integrator, and an autoclave thermometer into the autoclave:

    1. Ensure proper spacing to allow for steam circulation.

    1. Place the integrator and thermometer closest to the vent.

    1. All packages should have the plastic side down, with minimal overlap.

1. Use the appropriate autoclave cycle for packaged metal instruments: *270&deg; F at 30 PSI for 25 minutes*.

    1. Set the autoclave to "Fill" until the water reaches the fill line.

    1. Set the autoclave to "Sterilize."

    1. Set the timer for 35 minutes.

    1. Verify that proper heat and pressure are reached within 10 minutes.

1. After the cycle completes, turn the autoclave to "Vent" and slightly open the door.

1. Allow the residual water to evaporate and the packages to cool for an hour ensuring the HEPA air purifier is running the entire time to prevent airborne contaminants.

{% include heading_block.html title="Cooling and Storage" %}

1. Inspect the packaging for integrity, ensuring there are no tears, moisture, or compromised seals.

1. Store the sterilized hooks in a clean, dry, and dust-free environment until the next use.

{% include heading_block.html title="Documentation" %}

Document the maximum temperature, maximum pressure, sterilization time, and date in the autoclave log. Include a photo of the Type 5 sterilization integrator and autoclave thermometer.
